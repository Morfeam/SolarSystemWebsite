			When researching the planets and Solar System, it isnt all guesswork. Here are some of my favorite Missions and Projects
			used to discover what we know today about our Solar System and beyond.

     	   <p>
		SOHO is a satellite used to originally learn more about our sun and obtain evidence of processes in and around the sun. This ranges from the Corona, Solar winds, Chromosphere, and the sun's internal structures and dynamics. In fact, this satellite has confirmed a lot of what we know today about the sun and helped us determine and monitor solar winds and forecasts of the magnetic field of our sun. SOHO is acting as our in the field solar weather man, who has been running for 24 years and is still running today.

     	   <p>
		One of the most important telescopes for direct imaging of the Solar System and beyond is the Hubble Space Telescope. From pictures of our planets to the Hubble Deep Field Image displaying all of the visible universe, this telescope has told us a lot and given us some beautiful images in all different spectrums of light. I may have some personal bias as I remember my mom showing images taken by Hubble, but as far as images and research go I think Hubble is my personal favorite telescope but out by NASA. Still working today and its been active for over 30 years!

     	   <p>
		Voyager 1 is simply put, one of the most incredible feats of engineering in almost all of human history. As it continues to fly out further into interstellar space, Voyager 1 gave us some of the best images of Jovian moons and planets to date and helped us discover many new moons, Jovian ring bands, and countless other objects in the outer Solar System. The Voyager missions still run today and Voyager 1 has been operating since 1977, over 43 years!!! We owe a lot of our knowledge of the outer Solar System to Voyager 1 and  Voyager 2, voyager 1's sister project.

     	   <h5 class="card-title">WISE / NEOWISE</h5>
     	   <p>
		WISE, which was later given a new name NEOWISE, is best described as a NASA brand CCTV camera, used for Earth's surveillance and safety. NEOWISE is used to scan the Solar System for potentially hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). NEOWISE can be compared as Earth's technological watchdog as it allows us to sleep at night knowing that there are not any hazardous objects hurling towards Earth. If we found dangerous objects near our orbit NEOWISE may be the first to detect the hazard. It is currently still in our orbit scanning for objects today, along with 10 years under its belt.
